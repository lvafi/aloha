This is a thoughtful write-up about my project...

- Create a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to find a path they need easily
- Optimize for 3 widths: mobile, min-width: 600px, and min-width: 1240px.


Technologies Used:

- Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Google Chrome Developer Tools
- Eye Dropper (Google Chrome extension)
- HTML Validator (https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file)
- CSS Validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload)
- JavaScript
- JQuery (https://jquery.com/)


Personal Learnings:

- I am a visual learner and writing out the design of a site helps me.

- The value of div tools can be very helpful in identifying underlying issues in code or assist in making a website consistent across many browsers. 

- My understanding of areas such as flexbox and JQuery are improving as I practice and test more often.
