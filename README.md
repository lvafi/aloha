## Personal Learnings:
This project allowed me to utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop a website and 
expand my knowledge in the following ways:

- The process of refactoring  my code to build a responsive website helped me understand the different properties one has to consider when using a mobile-first approach.

- The value of div tools can be very helpful in identifying underlying issues in code or assist in making a website consistent across many browsers. 

- My understanding of areas such as flexbox and JQuery are improving as I practice and test more often.
